Hi, I’m Sarah Jane.

I am currently a Production Coordinator for a manufacturer in North Carolina. I have been wanting to move away from this and get a fresh start in a new field.

I am in the process of taking the Google Data Analystics course. I chose GitHub to host my portfolio starting out.

Moving into Data Analytics is for new for me. Collecting data is something I have often had to do for work, but I haven't ever been on the side of manipulating that data to answers questions.

A little background about me. I have two Bachelors degrees, one in Chemistry and the other in Anthropology. My work experience comes from three manufacturing companies, each in different areas.
